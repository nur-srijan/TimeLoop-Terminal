## 2024-05-23 - Interactive Timeline & Keyboard Shortcuts
**Learning:** `egui`'s `allocate_exact_size` returns a `Response` object that can be used for both layout allocation and event handling. By changing the sense from `Sense::hover()` to `Sense::click()`, we can easily turn a static visualization (like a progress bar) into an interactive control (seek bar) without changing the visual rendering logic.
**Action:** Always check if a static visualization could benefit from being interactive. If so, simply upgrade the `Sense` and handle the `clicked()` or `dragged()` events using `interact_pointer_pos()`. Also, `!ctx.wants_keyboard_input()` is crucial for global shortcuts to avoid conflicts with text input widgets.
