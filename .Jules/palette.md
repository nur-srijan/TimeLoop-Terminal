## 2024-05-23 - Interactive Timeline in egui
**Learning:** `egui::Response` ownership can be tricky when chaining methods like `.on_hover_text()` if the response is needed for interaction checks (`.clicked()`, `.dragged()`). `on_hover_text` consumes `self` and returns a new `Response`.
**Action:** When adding tooltips to interactive elements where you also need to check interaction status, either check interaction *before* adding the tooltip, or use the builder pattern carefully (chaining) if you don't need the original variable afterwards. Or reassign: `let response = response.on_hover_text(...)`.
