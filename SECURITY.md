# Security Policy

This document describes the security policy for the TimeLoop Terminal repository. It outlines the process for responsibly reporting security vulnerabilities and the support scope for security updates.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for released versions that are officially maintained. When a version reaches its end-of-life, it will no longer receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in TimeLoop Terminal, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly.** Refrain from posting details on public forums, issue trackers, or social media until the issue is resolved.
2. **Contact us directly:**
   - Email: security@timeloop-terminal.example.com
   - Alternatively, you may use our [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/nur-srijan/TimeLoop-Terminal/security/advisories) if applicable.
3. Provide as much detail as possible about the vulnerability, including:
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Impact assessment
   - Any suggestions for mitigation (if available)

## Our Commitment

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities responsibly. Upon receiving a report, we will:

- Acknowledge receipt within a reasonable timeframe.
- Investigate and verify the vulnerability.
- Work on a remediation plan.
- Coordinate the public disclosure of the vulnerability after a fix is available.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a vulnerability has been confirmed and a fix is available, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability and provide an update. We encourage responsible disclosure practices to ensure the safety and security of all users.

## Additional Information
